Hi, My name is YuanChing Teng, but I prefer you call me Spencer. I was born and raised in Taiwan and had worked as a full-time research assistant at [MACLab](http://mac.citi.sinica.edu.tw/), one of the best music information retrieval lab in Taiwan, for three years. My biggest project is a context-aware music recommendation prototype for mobile devices.

My job includes machine learning and a bit signal processing. In 2014 I came to Denmark for my Master degree at the University of Copenhagen. My thesis is a 3D medical image segmentation pipeline using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

After graduation I had work at a research-based company, [Biomediq A/S](http://www.biomediq.com/) for six months to continue my work in deep learning for medical imaging analysis. Now I am a part-time freelancer on Upwork and provide customers machine learning based solutions while seeking for a full-time position as a data scientist/engineer.

Besides machine learning and programming, I also like cooking, playing tennis, and backpacking (by cycling).
